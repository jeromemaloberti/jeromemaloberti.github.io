I finally decided to write a blog about my interests. I hesitated for a long time because it is difficult for me, given my impostor syndrome, to expose myself like this.
As a non native english speaker, I am very self-conscious about my writing. Years ago, during my PhD research, a reviewer of a paper I was submitting, mentioned the limitations of my English. It was disheartening. I had to hire a professional writer, as suggested by the reviewer, who actually made very minimal changes.">

<p>I finally decided to write a blog about my interests. I hesitated for a long time because it is difficult for me, given my impostor syndrome, to expose myself like this.</p>
<p>As a non native english speaker, I am very self-conscious about my writing. Years ago, during my PhD research, a reviewer of a paper I was submitting, mentioned the limitations of my English. It was disheartening. I had to hire a professional writer, as suggested by the reviewer, who actually made very minimal changes.</p>
<p>Later, while I was co-writing another paper with a researcher in the U.S., he rewrote parts of my text in a very concise manner while preserving all the information. I was very impressed, and became even more aware of my limitation in English.</p>
<p>My wife, also not an english native, uses ChatGPT for official correspondance and she really impressed me few times by her skillful use of LLMs. I recently embraced them as assistants myself, experimenting first with code generation because it is easy for me️ to evaluate the quality of the output. They are especially useful for tedious tasks like finding the right API in Python. Then I realized that I could use them to address my fear of writing by checking my blog posts&rsquo; grammar and style.</p>
<p>This post is my first attempt, and my workflow with language models is still a work in progress. I want them to help me improve, not to do my homework! The first version of this post was ideas without much structure, and when I asked it to improve it, the result felt like someone else wrote it. The tone was also very assertive and confident, my total opposite. I then asked it to keep my original style, and only improve the post slightly, even though describing my writing as a &ldquo;style&rdquo; is a bit of a stretch. The result was still disappointing, with only very minor changes.</p>
<p>Finally, I asked it to evaluate the quality of the post. In retrospect, I wish I had added to evaluate the post, &ldquo;as a kind English mentor&rdquo;, as the feedback was a bit harsh, while perfectly justified. My ego was unharmed, fortunately. It pointed out the lack of transitions between the paragraphs, and that the absence of conclusion made it sound unfinished. It also mentionned that starting an introductory post with &ldquo;finally&rdquo; is confusing, but I like it that way, so I will keep it. I took the critics constructively and decided to rewrite it almost entirely.</p>
<p>I really appreciate the LLM&rsquo;s lack of judgment and constant availability. I usually try to not rely too much on human experts, to avoid wasting their time, but I obviously don&rsquo;t have the same restrain toward the LLMs running on my machine or remotely. I still prefer using local LLMs, because of the responsiveness, even if it means using smaller models.</p>
<p>For the blog itself, I found Hugo to be the right tool for me (at least so far). It&rsquo;s fast and there are many existing blogs where I can &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; design ideas and features. Choosing a theme for this blog was a long process, and I hope I made the right choice.</p>
<p>The generation of the homepage image (the cat with glasses) took some time to reach a satisfyng result.
First, I had to decide what the image should be. Initially, I toyed with the idea of a concrete programmer, then a programmer with a beard and glasses. Finally, I settled on a cat with glasses (it&rsquo;s based on the example prompt on the FLUX.1 page of Hugging Face) holding a sign with &ldquo;C++ Ocaml&rdquo; written on it.</p>
<p>Secondly, I wanted to experiment with image generation on my computer. I tried different small models but failed to  generate a good image with them (stable diffusion 1.5 and 2.0). I couldn&rsquo;t install any image generation UIs on my computer, so I wrote a small script using the excellent Diffuser library by Hugging Face, and ran the FLUX.1 model on my machine. I like the result, but the generation time is too long for quick iterations during the branstorming phase. I will need to find a lighter, but still good, model later.</p>
<p>The name of the Blog, Concrete Programmer, came to me years ago, after looking at a book titled &ldquo;Concrete Mathematics&rdquo;. At that time, I thought that mathematics were very abstract, and I interpreted the title as &ldquo;Non-Abstract Mathematics&rdquo;, which would be the meaning in French. I never read the book, so I am quite likely wrong, since there is the field of Applied Mathematics. I still like Concrete Programmer, and Pragmatic Programmer is already taken anyway.</p>
<p>For an introductory post, I realize it is quite long. And it took me a long time to write it down with the help of my assistant (Gemma2). I hope it is only the first and that more posts will come soon.</p>
